In this push, I've started working on a little UI. I've setup a nav bar and started exploring style choices. I'm currently planning to have a user icon as a drop down button. I'm using radix and trying to figure out how to use the <Avatar> to trigger the drop down. Using the below discussion, I do have an idea on how to do this. However, the 'use child' is being really awkward and it seems no matter where I place it, it's not happy

I've also setup my DB connection.
